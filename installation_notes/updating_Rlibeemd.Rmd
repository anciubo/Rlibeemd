```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Preliminaries

On Linux, libeemd needs obviously GSL, so 
```{bash, eval = FALSE }
sudo apt-get install libgsl2 libgsl-dev
```

# When libeemd changes, what needs to be done in Rlibeemd

## libeemd, develop branch

   - Instead of having single eemd.h file, now the functions are separated.
   - This didn't seem to have big ramifications, just moved around definitions a bit between extras.h and eemd.h
   
   
## libeemd, bemd branch
