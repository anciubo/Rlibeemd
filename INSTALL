Underlying C library of libeemd needs GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in order to work. 
For Unix platforms everything should work assuming GSL is installed. 
For windows it is assumed that environment variable LIB_GSL points to the location of GSL.
Compiling GSL for Windows can be difficult, so easiest way to proceed as follows.

1. Download local300.zip from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/
2. Extract all the files somewhere, for example C:/GSL
3. Add environment variable LIB_GSL which points to the above defined directory
